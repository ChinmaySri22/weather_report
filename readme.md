## Creating API Keys

You will need API keys for OpenWeatherMap to fetch the required data.

2. Sign up or log in.
3. Go to your [API keys page](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and create a new API key.

After obtaining your API keys, create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```sh
API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
```

Replace `your_mapbox_access_token` and `your_openweathermap_api_key` with your actual API keys.
